negative,"while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw ."
negative,"all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags ."

positive,"lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest ."
positive,duvall is strong as always .
negative,"[e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism ."
negative,"if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world ."

positive,enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast .
negative,it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
positive,"the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture ."
negative,"an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow ."
